Solutions for:
(a) to create a handler for ELF (executable and linking format) files in Linux. 
Your program should display important information about file under consideration. Name of executable file to be processed should be a command line argument. 
Output should be written to a file called output.txt.
(b) to verify if entropy can be used to distinguish different file formats. 
We shall be considering encrypted files (Use AxCrypt or any other open source utility for encryption say AES, RSA, DES), compressed files (zip/rar/z7/gz), document (.doc, .odt) 
and text files. You need to evaluate entropy of atleast 20 files in each category and determine if this entropy value can be used as discriminator/classification of files.
