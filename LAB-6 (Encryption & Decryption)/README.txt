PROBLEM STATEMENT 

Implement following encryption algorithms (and respective decryption algorithms)
(1) Playfair Cipher
(2) Hill Cipher
(3) DES
(4) AES
(5) RC4
Plaintext, key  needs to be read from input.dat and output should be cipher.dat. 
In input.dat, the first line shall be plaintext  and subsequent line shall contain key.
 In case of Hill cipher, second line shall be first row of encryption matrix and subsequent 
lines shall represent successive rows.
Alphabet set  for plaintext shall consist of  {a, b, ...., y, z, 0, 1, ..., 8, 9}.
