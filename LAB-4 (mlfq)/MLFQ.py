'''
Multilevel Feedback Queue Scheduling (MLFQ) CPU Scheduling
YUKTI KHURANA

0 -> highest priority queue
q-1 -> lowest priority queue

Basic rules for MLFQ:

Rule 1: If Priority(A) > Priority(B), A runs (B doesnâ€™t).
Rule 2: If Priority(A) = Priority(B), A & B run in RR.
Rule 3: When a job enters the system, it is placed at the highest priority (the topmost queue). 
Rule 4:  T1 (time after which the priority is downgraded by -1) and T2( time after which priority is upgraded by +1)
